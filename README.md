### Reflection
This article nails the difference between developers and engineers: the former build the apps we use, while the latter design the systems that keep them running at scale. Beyond just knowing Python or Java, the real takeaway here is that staying relevant now depends on adaptability and AI literacy. It's a reminder that career growth isn't just about getting better at coding—it's about shifting your mindset from finishing a task to designing a strategic system.

### Comment by Celia Liang

Interesting perspective. I think AI might actually be amplifying the gap between developers and engineers rather than blurring it. When code generation becomes trivial, the scarce skill is not writing code.  Instead, it is knowing when to use AI, when not to, and how to integrate it into broader system decisions. That said, the article implicitly assumes "engineer > developer" as the natural career progression, but this does not hold true everywhere. In fields that prioritize creativity, user experience, or rapid iteration, deep development skills remain irreplaceable in their own right.
