### My Reflection
This article nails the difference between developers and engineers: the former build the apps we use, while the latter design the systems that keep them running at scale. Beyond just knowing Python or Java, the real takeaway here is that staying relevant now depends on adaptability and AI literacy. It's a reminder that career growth isn't just about getting better at coding—it's about shifting your mindset from finishing a task to designing a strategic system.

Interesting perspective. I think AI might actually be amplifying the gap between developers and engineers rather than blurring it. When code generation becomes trivial, the scarce skill is not writing code.  Instead, it is knowing when to use AI, when not to, and how to integrate it into broader system decisions. That said, the article implicitly assumes "engineer > developer" as the natural career progression, but this does not hold true everywhere. In fields that prioritize creativity, user experience, or rapid iteration, deep development skills remain irreplaceable in their own right.

I found the article’s breakdown useful because it frames the developer versus engineer distinction as a difference in responsibility rather than skill level. The important points on system-wide thinking, failure cases, and long-term maintenance made it clear why engineering roles often require broader context beyond writing correct code.

Meanwhile, the career paths described feel more like tendencies than strict rules. In fact, especially in smaller teams or fast-moving environments, developers are often required to think like engineers as well. This help me realize that developing an engineering mindset early can be valuable regardless of the specific job title.
